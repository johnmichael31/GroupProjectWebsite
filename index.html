          Backyard farming is a movement in which everyday spaces are turned
          into mini or micro-farms. It's a deliberate approach to growing and
          harvesting your own fruits and vegetables in a sustainable way without
          worrying about needing a large area. You donâ€™t need a big chunk of
          land to make it happen. So, where does it begin? What makes this
          possible?

            <h2>Benefits of Having a Family Garden</h2>
            <p>

              promoting healthy eating and exercise habits as well as family
              bonding and stress relief. If you live in an urban area and/or

            <h2>Backyard gardening help the environment</h2>
            <p>
              Plants act as highly effective air cleaners, absorbing carbon
              dioxide, plus many air pollutants, while releasing clean oxygen
              and fragrance. Also, a dense cover of plants and mulch holds soil
              in place, reducing erosion and keeping sediment out of streams,
              storm drains and roads.
